## Description
A functional Express.js API that uses the latest technologies and serves as a back end for e-commerce.

## Installation
Clone repo: https://github.com/smcgarr13/E-commerce-Back-End

## Usage
To use this application, add your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to the environment variable file so you can connect to a database using Sequelize.  When you enter schema and seed commands, a development database will be created and seeded with the test data provided.  When you enter the command to invoke the application, your server will be started and the Sequelize models will be synced to the MySQL database.

When you open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes will be displayed in formatted JSON.  When you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, you will be able to successfully create, update, and delete data in your database.
